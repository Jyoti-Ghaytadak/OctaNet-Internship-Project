# OctaNet Internship Project
# ATM Machine Simulation

## Description

This project simulates the basic functionalities of an ATM machine using Python. The simulation includes the following features:
- Account balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal
- Cash deposit
- PIN change
- Transaction history

## Features

1. **Account Balance Inquiry**: Check the current balance of the account.
2. **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw a specified amount from the account, given there are sufficient funds.
3. **Cash Deposit**: Deposit a specified amount into the account.
4. **PIN Change**: Change the account's PIN after verifying the old PIN.
5. **Transaction History**: View the history of transactions performed on the account.

2) Run the Program
python atm_simulation.py

Usage
Here's a step-by-step guide to using the ATM Machine Simulation

Source Code...

#for stopping program execution for some time
import time

print("Please insert Your CARD")

#for card processing
time.sleep(5)

password = 1234

#taking atm pin from user
pin = int(input("enter your atm pin "))

#user account balance
balance = 5000

#checking pin is valid or not 
if pin == password:
    #loop will run user get free 
    while True:

 #Showing  info to user

   print(""" 
			1 == balance
			2 == withdraw balance
			3 == deposit balance
			4 == exit
			"""
              )

   try:    
    #taking an option from user
    option = int(input("Please enter your choise "))
   except:
    print("Please enter valid option")
        
   #for option 1        
   if option == 1:
            print(f"Your current balance is {balance}")
                                     
   if option == 2:

   withdraw_amount = int(input("please enter withdraw_amount "))
   balance = balance - withdraw_amount
           print(f"{withdraw_amount} is debited from your account")
           print(f"your updated balance is {balance}")
   
  if option == 3:

   deposit_amount = int(input("please enter deposit_amount")
   balance = balance + deposit_amount
           print(f"{deposit_amount} is credited to your account"
           print(f"your updated balance is {balance}")

 if option == 4:
 break

else:
    print("wrong pin Please try again")
